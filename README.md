# React Developer Assessment
## Summary
This programming exercise is calibrated to provide insight of the candidate's current React skills and understanding of common programming concepts, methods and patterns.
The uploaded result will be assessed by our subject-matter experts to evaluate if the candiate is a good match to the advertised position and whether the hiring process may be continued with the follow-up interviews.

## Assessment

The game list must be fetched from: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vbence86/83da491ff9830ad19ac6fa0a10162fc1/raw/d543204847b3d9896f0ce15d244bb89160fe0f86/games.json


## Acceptance Criteria
- The project folder of your solution is compressed into a `zip` archive
- This `zip` archive is sent over to our HR representative as an attachement
- The project folder contains a well-fromatted README.md that summarizes the solution
- The project also incorporates a `package.json` with at least the following scripts:
  * `publish` - Builds the react application into `/dist` folder
  * `start` - Starts a lightweight HTTP server on port 3000 that servers the application

## Nice to have
- Publish code is covered with unit tests
- React Hooks
- Application layout is fully responsive
